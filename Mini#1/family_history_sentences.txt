Although there is no smoke exposure there is a significant family history with both Abc's father and uncle having problems with asthma as well as his older sister.
The parents now maintain separate households and there has been a question about the consistency of his medication administration at his father's house.
We spent the majority of our 45-minute just reviewing basic principles of asthma management and I believe that Abc's mother is fairly well versed in this.
I have encouraged his mother to contact our office so that we can answer questions if necessary by phone.
