Sample Type: Cardiovascular / Pulmonary

					Sample Name: Stress Test Thallium
				

					
					Description: 
					Thallium stress test for chest pain.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)


			
			
				INDICATIONS:  Chest pain.

STRESS TECHNIQUE:   The patient exercised for 5.0 minutes to a heart rate of 133.  ECG was normal.  Patient achieved 7.0 METS.

IMAGE TECHNIQUE:  The patient was injected with 4.2 millicuries of thallous chloride and subsequently imaged on the gated tomographic SPECT system.

IMAGE ANALYSIS:  There is normal LV myocardial perfusion.  The LV systolic ejection fraction is normal at 79%.  There is normal global and regional wall motion of the left ventricle.

CONCLUSIONS:
1.  Normal ECG stress.
2.  Reduced aerobic capacity of 7 METS.
3.  Normal LV myocardial perfusion.
4.  Normal LV systolic ejection fraction of 79%.
5.  Normal global and regional wall motion of the left ventricle.
