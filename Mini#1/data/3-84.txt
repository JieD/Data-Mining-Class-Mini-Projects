(Medical Transcription Sample Report)


			
			
				PROTOCOL:  Bruce.

PERTINENT MEDICATION:  None.

REASON FOR TEST:  Chest pain.

PROCEDURE AND INTERPRETATION: 
1.  Baseline heart rate:  67.
2.  Baseline blood pressure:  150/86.
3.  Total time:  6 minute 51 seconds.
4.  METs:  10.1.
5.  Peak heart rate:  140.
6.  Percent of maximum-predicted heart rate:  90.
7.  Peak blood pressure:  200/92.
8.  Reason test terminated:  Shortness of breath and fatigue.
9.  Estimated aerobic capacity:  Average.
10. Heart rate response:  Normal.
11. Blood pressure response:  Hypertensive.
12. ST segment response:  Normal.
13. Chest pain:  None.
14. Symptoms:  None.
15. Arrhythmia:  None.

CONCLUSION:
