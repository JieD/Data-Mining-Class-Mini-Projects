Sample Type: Cardiovascular / Pulmonary

					Sample Name: Stress Test Dobutamine
				

					
					Description: 
					Dobutamine stress test for atrial fibrillation.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)


			
			
				INDICATIONS:  Atrial fibrillation, coronary disease.

STRESS TECHNIQUE: The patient was infused with dobutamine to a maximum heart rate of 142.  ECG exhibits atrial fibrillation.

IMAGE TECHNIQUE:  The patient was injected with 5.2 millicuries of thallous chloride and subsequently imaged on the gated tomographic SPECT system.

IMAGE ANALYSIS:  It should be noted that the images are limited slightly by the patient's obesity with a weight of 263 pounds.  There is normal LV myocardial perfusion.  The LV systolic ejection fraction is normal at 65%.  There is normal global and regional wall motion.

CONCLUSIONS:
1.  Basic rhythm of atrial fibrillation with no change during dobutamine stress, maximum heart rate of 142.
2.  Normal LV myocardial perfusion.
3.  Normal LV systolic ejection fraction of 65%.
4.  Normal global and regional wall motion.
