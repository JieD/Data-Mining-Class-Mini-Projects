				The patient was placed in left lateral decubitus position and the above medications were administered.  The colonoscope was advanced to the cecum, as identified by the ileocecal valve, appendiceal orifice, and blind pouch.  The colonoscope was slowly withdrawn and a careful examination of the colonic mucosa was made, including a retroflexed view of the rectum.  The remainder of the examination was normal to the cecum.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without complication.
