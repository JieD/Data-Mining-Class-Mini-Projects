# This script will go through a list of files and extract all sentences that contain a family member.
#
# Command line arguments:
# [input]  - a txt file with a list of Absolute file paths
# [output] - a text file containing all of the sentences that include family member
# input:  report_file_names.txt
# output: family_history_sentences.txt
#
# usage: $python extract_sentences_containing_family_member.py [input] [output]
#
# use this grep command to find all files that contian family members and outputs them to ffiles.txt
# egrep -i -w -l -f fnames ~/Documents/csc898/dataset/dataA/* > ffiles.txt
# where fnames is a file that only contains the line:
# (mother|brother|grandfather|sister|grandmother|father|mom|dad|son|daughter|uncle|aunt|niece|nephew|cousin)('s|s)*
#  ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) _ +  // remember the position of the metachars
#
# This file is modified based on Neal Lewis's Family Member Sentence Splitter.
